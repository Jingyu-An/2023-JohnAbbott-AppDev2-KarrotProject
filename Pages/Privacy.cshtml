    <h1>Karrot Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>(Effective Date: August 2022)</p>

    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

    <p>Daangn Inc. and our affiliates ("<strong>Company</strong>" or "<strong>We</strong>") respect your
        privacy and are committed to protecting it by complying with this
        privacy policy (this "<strong>Policy</strong>").</p>

    <p>This Policy sets out:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The types of information we may collect or that app users
                ("<strong>you</strong>") may provide when you download, install, register with,
                access or use the Karrot mobile application software ("<strong>App</strong>") and
                any of the services accessible through the App available on
                "ca.karrotmarket.com" or other sites of ours (the "<strong>Service
                    Sites</strong>", and collectively with the App, "<strong>Karrot</strong>") regarding the
                collection, use, storage, transfer, and protection of your personal
                data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and
                disclosing that information.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>We will only use your personal information in accordance with this
        Policy unless otherwise required by applicable law. We take steps to
        ensure that the personal information that we collect about you is
        adequate, relevant, not excessive, and used for limited purposes.</p>

    <p>Privacy laws in Canada generally define "personal information" as any
        information about an identifiable individual, which includes information
        that can be used on its own or with other information to identify,
        contact, or locate a single person.</p>

    <p>This Policy applies only to information we collect through or in
        connection with Karrot, in email, text, and other electronic
        communications sent through or in connection with Karrot. This Policy
        DOES NOT apply to information that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We collect offline.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You provide to or is collected by any third party.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>SCOPE AND CONSENT</h3>

    <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and
        practices for collecting, processing, and storing your information. If
        you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download,
        register with, or use the App or visit the Service Sites.</p>

    <p>By downloading, registering with, using or visiting the App and/or the
        Service Sites, you indicate that you understand, accept and consent to
        us for the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal
        information as described in this Policy.</p>

    <p>This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy
        Policy). Your continued use of the App and visits to the Service Sites
        after we make changes indicates that you accept and consent to those
        changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates. We will
        notify you in advance of any material changes to this Policy and obtain
        your consent to any new ways that we collect, use, and disclose your
        personal information.</p>

    <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>

    <p>We collect information about you through:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Direct interactions with you when you provide it to us, for example,
                by filling in applications or corresponding with us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Automated technologies or interactions, when you use the App or the
                Services Sites, for example, usage details, and IP addresses.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>The types of information that we collect include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Personal information</strong> that we can reasonably use to directly or
                indirectly identify you, such as your telephone number, internet
                protocol (IP) address, username or other similar identifier, and any
                other identifier we may use to contact you ("<strong>personal</strong>
                <strong>information</strong>").
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Non-personal information</strong> that does not directly or indirectly
                reveal your identity or directly relate to an identified individual,
                such as demographic information, or statistical or aggregated
                information. We may derive non-personal statistical or aggregated
                data from personal information. For example, we may aggregate
                personal information to calculate the percentage of users accessing
                a specific app feature.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Technical information</strong>, including your device type, time zone
                setting, and usage details.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

    <p>When you download, register with, or use the App or access, use or visit
        the Service Sites, we may ask you to provide:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Information by filling in forms in Karrot. This includes information
                you provide when registering to use the App and/or Service Sites,
                subscribing to our service, posting material, or requesting further
                services. We may also ask you for information when you report a
                problem with the App.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Records and copies of your correspondence, including phone numbers,

        </li>
        <li>

                research or other purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Details of transactions you carry out through the App and/or Service

            <p>Your search queries on Karrot.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>You may also provide information (including without limitation profile
        images, photos, videos, or other digital content) for publication or
        display ("<strong>posted</strong>") on public areas of the App and/or the Service
        Sites (collectively, "<strong>User Contributions</strong>"). You post and transmit
        User Contributions to others at your own risk. We cannot control the
        actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User
        Contributions. Therefore, we do not guarantee that unauthorized persons
        will not view your User Contributions.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Information Collection and Tracking Technologies</strong></p>

    <p>When you download, access, and use the App, it may automatically
        collect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Usage details.</strong> When you access and use the App or the Service
                Sites, we may automatically collect certain details of your access
                to and use of the App or the Service Sites, including traffic data,
                location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources
                that you access and use on or through the App.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Device information.</strong> We may collect information about your mobile
                device and internet connection, including the device's unique
                device identifier, IP address, operating system, mobile network
                information, and the device's telephone number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Stored information and files.</strong> The App also may access metadata
                and other information associated with other files stored on your
                device. This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video
                clips, personal contacts, and address book information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Location information.</strong> The App collects real-time information
                about the location of your device to determine and authenticate your
                location for purposes of determining your "neighbourhood" market
                (which is generally a maximum of a 25 KM radius surrounding your
                location) and the local bulletin board that you can post and
                transact on.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>The information we collect automatically is statistical information and
        may include personal information. We may maintain it or associate it
        with personal information we collect in other ways, or that you provide
        to us. This usage information helps us to improve our App and to deliver
        a more personalized service, including by helping us to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Store information about your preferences and customize our App
                according to your individual interests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Speed up your searches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Recognize you when you use the App.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>If you do not want us to collect this information, do not download the
        App or delete it from your device. For more information, see How We Use
        Your Information. Note, however, that opting out of the App's
        collection of location information will cause its location-based
        features to be disabled.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Information Collection</strong></p>

    <p>When you use the App or its content, certain third parties collect
        information about you or your device. These third parties may include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Other users of the App</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Analytics companies.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>You can opt-out of several third party ad servers' and networks'
        cookies simultaneously by using an opt-out tool created by the Digital
        Advertising Alliance of Canada. You can also access this website to
        learn more about online behavioural advertising and how to stop websites
        from placing cookies on your device. Opting out of a network does not
        mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that
        the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored
        to your web preferences and usage patterns.</p>

    <p>For more information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted
        advertising, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.</p>

                dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Daangn
                Inc.'s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy,

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to
                support our business, such as analytics and search engine providers

    <h3>TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>We may transfer personal information that we collect or that you provide
        us to contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to

        information with the same standards set out in this policy.</p>

    <p>We may process, store, and transfer your personal information in and to
        other countries with different privacy laws that may or may not be as
        comprehensive as Canadian law. In these circumstances, the governments,
        courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country may be
        able to obtain access to your personal information. Whenever we engage a
        service provider, we require that its privacy and security standards
        comply with this policy and applicable Canadian laws.</p>

    <p>By submitting your personal information or engaging with the App, you
        consent to this transfer, storage, or processing.</p>

    <h3>CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information
        you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the
        following control over your information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Location Information.</strong> In order to deliver our services, the App
                will collect and use real-time information about your device's
                location. If you block the use of location information, the App may
                be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Promotional Offers from the Company.</strong> If you have opted in to
                receive certain emails and/or push notifications from us but no
                longer wish for us to use your contact information to promote our
                own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by
                sending us an email stating your request to <a
                    href="mailto:help@karrotmarket.com">help@karrotmarket.com</a>
                or by opting out of receiving promotional push notifications in the
                App. If we have sent you a promotional email, you may unsubscribe by
                clicking the unsubscribe link we have included in the email. This
                opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as
                part of a product purchase, warranty registration, product service
                experience, or other transactions. You can also always opt-out by
                logging into the App and adjusting your user preferences in your
                account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes or by
                sending us an email stating your request to <a
                    href="mailto:help@karrotmarket.com">help@karrotmarket.com</a>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>DATA SECURITY</h3>

    <p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. We
        use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to secure
        your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
        access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We store all information you
        provide to us behind firewalls on secure servers. Any data, information
        and transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology and/or AES
        (256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard). Once we have received your
        information, we will use strict security features and procedures to
        prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or
        accessed in an unauthorized way. We will collect and store personal data
        on your devices using application data caches and browser web storage
        (including HTML5 and other technology).</p>

    <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where
        we have given you (or you have chosen) a password for access to certain
        parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping it confidential. We
        ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be
        careful about giving out information in public areas of the App like
        message boards, which any user can view. Certain services include social
        networking, chat room or forum features. Ensure when using these
        features that you do not submit any personal data that you do not want
        to be seen, collected or used by other users. We have put in place
        procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will
        notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to
        do so.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet and
        mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to
        protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of
        your personal information transmitted through the App. Any transmission
        of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for
        circumvention of any App privacy settings or security measures.</p>

    <h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>

    <p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or
        regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as
        necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the
        purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
        Under some circumstances we may anonymize or aggregate your personal
        information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve
        the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any
        legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your
        consent.</p>

    <h3>ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is
        accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal
        information changes. By law you have the right to request access to and

        personal information that you have provided to us. We may not
        accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change
        would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to
        be incorrect.
    </p>

    <p>We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your
        identity and your right to access, and to provide you with the personal
        information that we hold about you or make your requested changes.
        Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with
        access to some or all of the personal information that we hold about
        you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal information
        anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and
        practices. If we cannot provide you with access to your personal
        information, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal
        or regulatory restrictions.</p>
